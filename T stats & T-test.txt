when to use z-test:
===========
  when we have pop. std.dev.(sigma) and sample size(n>=30) then we have to use z-test.
  
 But what if we don't have pop. std.dev. as sometimes we might not have complete data, we just can have subset of data.

when pop. std. dev. is not given, then we can use T-test. 


T-stats & T-test:
=================
1. In the population, the avg IQ is 100. A team of researchers want to test a new application to see if it is either a + or - effect on intelligence or no effect at all. A sample of 30 participants who have taken the medication has a mean of 140 with std. dev. of 20 Did the medication affect IQ??



Here IQ can increase or decrease, so it becomes a 2 tailed test.

CI = conf. int. = 95%   so alpha=0.05

we should be doing analysis on this sample data to find and conclude whether the intelligence has increased or not..

Ans : mue = pop. mean=100  n=sample size=30 
  sample mean( "x" bar=140)     sample std. dev. = 20
 Here sigma(population std. dev.) is not given. So we have to use T-test.

Null hypothesis (what is the basic assumption in the question):
 H0 = mue = mean = 100 data that is already mentioned in question.
 
Alternate hypothesis : H1 (what is that we are testing for)
  mue!=100, we might get avg. IQ(mue) <100 0r > 100.  Hence it is 2-tailed test.
  
  
 alpha = 0.05

dof = degree of freedom -> with the help of this only we can check for area in t-table.
  = n-1 = 30-1 = 29

Decision rule(based on visualization curve): 
  we have 95% of area,(because we want 95% CI) and remaining 5% area on either sides of 95% area.(2.5% on each side) as the curve is symmetric curve.
  
  
Now we need to find z-score by using t-table.
 For 2 tailed test, with alpha=0.05, along the rows in table we can see dof, go over dof=29
 we get "2.045"
 
 so z-score=2.045(It means how many standard deviations it is away from)
 
 So the z-scores are "-2.045 and +2.045".
 
 If our score for t-test is < -2.045 or > +2.045 then we reject the null hypothesis or else we accept the null hypothesis.
 
 1. calculate test statistic.
 
   t-score = ("x" bar - mue(population mean))/(sample std. dev./(n^1/2))
   =(140-100)/(20/(30^1/2)) = 10.96 
   
   "t=10.96"
   
   ====
  since t-test value > +2.045, the areas which are on either sides of 95% are rejection areas
   the 95% area(of CI) is the acceptance area for Null hypothesis.
   
 So here we have to reject the null hypothesis.

conclusion: 
 Medication used has affected the IQ and IQ is increased as 10.96 is on right side of mue=10.

Medication has increased the IQ.

This example is "1 sample t-test".
