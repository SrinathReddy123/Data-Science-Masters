Normal/Gaussian Distribution:
  It is an important and most observed distribution in nature.
  
 we have important formula called empirical formula about Normal/Gaussian distribution,which
   will help us to make some assumptions, about specific dataset.
   
 For a symmetric distrbution, 50% of data will be on left side of mean(mue) and remaining 50%
  of data will be on right side of mean(mue).
  
  If a given random variable follows Gaussian distrbution, then it will be of Bell shape.
   Both sides are symmetric to each other and in middle of curve we will be having mean.
   
   If we go towards right, then we have mean+sigma(std. dev.) then mean+2*sigma
     where sigma = standard deviation
  If we go towards left, then we have mean-sigma(std. dev.) then mean-2*sigma.
  
Importance of Normal/Gaussian distrbution and assumptions that we can make from this:
 =================
  Empirical rule : 68-95-99.7
  Empirical rule is also called as 3Sigma rule.

  
 when we have random variable that follows gaussian distribution(exact symmetric distr.), then 
  within 1st std. dev. from mean(on both left and right side combined) we will have 68% of entire distribution of data.
  within 2 std. dev. from mean(on both left and right side combined) we will have 95% of entire distribution of data.
  
  within 3 std. dev. from mean(on both left and right side combined) we will have 99.7% of entire distribution of data.
  
  
  when we have random variable that follows gaussian distribution  then it follows the Empirical rule mentioned above.
  
  
  How can we know if a random variable follows gaussian distribution or not??
  -> Q-Q plot(Quantile Quantile plot) wll help us to know if a distrbution is gaussian or not.
  
  
  
  P((mue-sigma)<= x <= (mue+sigma)) = 68% -> This is in terms of probability.
   -> Probability of a random variable to fall/lie between 1 standard deviation.
   
   
   similarly for P((mue-(2*sigma))<= x <= (mue+(2*sigma)) )=95%  
   similarly for P((mue-(3*sigma))<= x <= (mue+(3*sigma)) )=99.7%
   
   
 Eg: Height and weight 
    iris dataset( we have 4 features sepal length, petal length, sepal width and petal width)
	 
 From this we can also find the area under the curve.
