Standard Normal Distribution:
=================
Normal/Gaussian distribution with mean(mue)=0 and standard deviation=1 is called Standard Normal distribution.

Here we learn about Z-score, with the help of z-score we can identify any value how much standard deviation is it away from the mean.

Let's consider a random variable with values {1,2,3,4,5} and following normal distribution
 with mean=3 and std. dev. = 1.414

In general Normal/Gaussian distribution can have any mean and any standard deviation.


Now assume that we want to convert this distribution into other distribution where mean=0 and 
  std. dev. = 1. then such distribution is called standard normal distribution.
  
  How does this conversion can be done??
  -> w euse z-score formula.
  
  z=(x-mue)/sigma   mue=mean of that feature and sigma=standard deviation of feature.
  
  For simplicity , let's assume std dev. = 1.
  
  for 1 =  1-3/1 = -2.
  for 2 =  2-3/1 = -1.
  for 3 = 3-3/1 = 0.
  for 4 = 4-3/1 = 1.
  for 5 = 5-3/1 = 2.
   
   
   so new distribution have values{-2,-1,0,1,2}and this will be normal distribution. 
     Here mean = 0 and std.dev. =1
	 
	 
A random variable belongs to standard normal distribution if it's mean=0 and std. dev. =1.


why z-score is important??
-> Assume we have curve(for a distribution) we have mean=4 and std.dev=1	 
	 
Q. How many standard deviation 4.25 is away from mean??
 here "x"=4.25	  z-score = 4.25 - 4/1 = 0.25
It means 4.25 is 0.25 std. dev. away from the mean.

we can also find the area between 4 and 4.25 by using z-table 
	 
2.  How many standard deviation 2.5 is away from mean??  
here "x"=2.5	  z-score = 2.5 - 4/1 = -1.5

It means 4.25 is -1.5 std. dev. away from the mean.


Eg: Assume we have a dataset, 
Age(years)    weight(kg)   Height(cm)  salary(rupees)
24      70       175     20k
24      65       170     30k
25      69       165     27k
26      75       187     25k
27      60       175     35k


here for all the features units will be different, 
 when we create a Machine learning model, the 1st rule is we try to bring all the features in same unit scale.

If we are able to bring all the features in the same value range, there are many algorithms 
 like clustering algorithms, Linear regression these models require all the values to be in 
 same unit, so that ML algorithms will be able to optimize themselves in a better way and so 
 will give better performance.
 
 In clustering algorithms, we try to find the distance.

we convert all the features using a technique called Standardization.(Apply z-score formula on
 each and every feature.)
 
 we can bring efficiency and performance in model, in a better way.
 
 
 There is other technique called Min max normalization. 
   x = (x-min)/(max-min) -> for a feature for all the values of that feature we can apply this.
   
   min - minimum value of the feature
   max - maximum value of the feature
