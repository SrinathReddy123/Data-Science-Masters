We can then rank the features by their p-values or other metrics, such as mutual information or F-scores, and select the top K features.\n",

Common resampling techniques include random oversampling, random undersampling, and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).\n",

This can help the model prioritize correctly classifying the minority class, even if it leads to more errors in the majority class.\n",

    "3.Threshold adjustment: Logistic regression outputs probability estimates for each class, which are converted to binary predictions based on a threshold value (usually 0.5). Adjusting this threshold can help balance the precision and recall of the model and improve its performance on the minority class. For example, we can lower the threshold to increase the recall (i.e., sensitivity) of the model for the minority class at the expense of lower precision (i.e., more false positives).\n",

In logistic regression, we can use ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting, or stacking, to create a diverse set of models that can better handle the imbalanced dataset. For example, we can use boosting to create a sequence of models that focus on the misclassified instances of the minority class and gradually improve their performance."
