Confidence Interval & Margin of error:
=================================
 Till now with respect to Confidence Interval, we have solved problems with the help of t-stats
  and z-stats.
  
Let's say if CI is 95% and if it is 2 tailed test, then we create a curve with z-scores where 
  acceptance area is 95% and rejecting area is 2.5% on either sides.
  
  From z-test or p-value if it lies in the region, then we will accept Null hypothesis, if it 
   comes in any extreme ends then we reject Null hypothesis.
   
Initially when we are trying to solve z-stats or t-stats, then we had sample mean and we tried to make conclusion about population mean.

point estimate:
==============
 "x"bar is the point estimate, to probably estimate the population mean.
 
let's say "x"bar=2.5 and mean=mue= 3 
 For some samples, sample mean ("x"bar can be > 3)
 
In both the cases, there will be a difference and that's the problem of using point estimate.

Hence we define some range of confidence interval. 
 ler's say our point estimate lies between CI 2 to 4. Then we can represent the estimation of population parameter. 

This range that we consider is called Confidence Interval.
 In this we define some intervals with respect to some confidence level. For specifying CI 
 we use a formula :
   point estimate+_ margin of error.

point estimate can be less or greater than or equal to the population mean.

How do we calculate Margin of error?
=============
 we use "z alpha/2"   
 
 For z-test, = "x"bar +_ ("z alpha/2" * (sigma/n^1/2))
 
 For t-test =  "x"bar +_ ("t alpha/2" * (sigma/n^1/2))
  we need to calculate dof(degree of freedom)
  
Eg: On the verbal section of CAT exam is the std. dev. is known to be 100. A sample of 30 tests takers has a mean of 520. construct 95% CI about the mean?

alpha = 0.05 => so alpha/2 = 0.025

when we say alpha/2, we are considering it as 2 tailed test. 

so we have curve with 95% area of acceptance region, and 2.5% on either sides of 95% area. 
To find the area on right extreme(2.5%) we can find area from left most extreme(till +z-score at right side of 95%) .

1- (area from left most extreme(till +z-score at right side of 95%) = we get area of right extreme 2.5%

1-0.025 = 0.9750 -> so with respect to this, the area under the curve 0.9750 is +1.96 which is z-score(how many std. dev. is mean away from). The other side, it will be -1.96 the z-score for this at left extreme of 95% area.

Lower CI =  520 - (1.96)*(100/(25^1/2)) = 480.8
Right CI =  520 + (1.96)*(100/(25^1/2)) = 559.2


So our 95% CI lies between 480.8 and 559.2 these 2 values.

we are 95% confidence that CAT exam avg score will lie between 480.8 and 559.2

I am 95% confidence about the mean CAT score is between 480.8 and 559.2
