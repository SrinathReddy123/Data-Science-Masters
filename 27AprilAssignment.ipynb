To address this, you can employ methods like the Elbow Method, Silhouette Analysis, Gap Statistic, or information criteria to determine the optimal value of K. Additionally, domain knowledge and expertise can provide valuable insights into the expected number of clusters.\n",

Alternatively, more advanced initialization techniques, such as K-means++, can be used to improve the initial centroid selection.\n",

    "4. Dealing with outliers: Outliers can significantly impact the clustering process, especially in K-means where the centroids are influenced by all data points. One approach is to perform outlier detection before clustering and either remove or handle outliers separately.
