    "Gradient Boosting Regression is a popular machine learning algorithm for regression problems that involves the construction of an ensemble of decision trees to predict the target variable. In this algorithm, each decision tree is built to correct the errors of the previous tree, and the final prediction is obtained by combining the predictions of all the trees."

    "The Gradient Boosting Regression algorithm works by iteratively adding decision trees to the ensemble, where each tree is built to minimize the residual error of the previous trees. The residual error is the difference between the actual target values and the predicted values of the previous trees. In other words, each new tree is trained to predict the difference between the target values and the predicted values of the previous trees."
