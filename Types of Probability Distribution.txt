Types of Probability Distribution:
===============================
 Probability Distributions are of various types. A prob. distri. can be of any particular type.
 
 It may belong to Prob. densit. func. or Prob. mass function.  Based on this different types 
  of probability distributions are present.
  
  1.Normal/Gaussian Distribution - 
  It is a part of probability density function
  most specifically belong to Probability density function.
  Here the curve will be like Bell shaped curve, which is of symmetric in nature.
  
  Most of the data that exists in our universe, will follow Normal/Gaussian distribution.
  
  Mostly in any dataset, one or the features will follow Normal/Gaussian distribution.
  
  2. Bernoulli distribution:
  
   It is a part of probability mass function.
   
   In this, for any experiment we have only 2 outcomes(success and failure). So bernoulli 
     experiment does follow discrete random variable.
   collection of Bernoulli experiments is called Binomial experiment.
   In Binomial experiment each outcome of any experiment can be classified as either success 
     or failure.
   A distribution in which we can classify 
   
   Most of our classification problems has data that follows Bernoulli distribution as it has only 2 outcomes.
   we might have a feature that follows Bernoulli distribution.
  3.Uniform distribution:


  4.Log normal distribution :
   It is part of prob density function.
   Log normal distribution can be converted to Normal/Gaussian distribution.
   
   why Log normal distribution has to be converted into Normal/Gaussian distribution?
    Because with respect to ML algorithms, some algorithms work really well with Normal/Gaussian distribution.
   
  5. Poisson distribution
  It follows a prob. mass function rule.

  6. Power law distribution:
   It follows pdf(prob density function) . It is 80 20 percent rule. pareto principle rule.
   
  7.Binomial distribution:
  It follows a prob. mass function rule. It means the data that is used in this distribution is discrete data.
