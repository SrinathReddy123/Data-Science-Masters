Hypothesis testing mechanism:
====================
 This is a part of inferential statistics, the main purpose of it is to come up with conclusions, from a sample data about a unknown population parameter.
 
 we make conclusions about some unknown parameter, it can be mean,variance,std. dev. 

How do we come up with some conclusions/inferences??
-> For this we use hypothesis testing.

How hypothesis testing and it's mechanism happens?
-> Hypothesis testing mechanism: (what are the steps involved):
 1. we need to write our Null hypothesis, denoted by H0.(The person is not guilty)
   Null hypothesis has the assumption you are beginning with.
   
 2. We should define our Alternate hypothesis(H1):(The person is guilty)
  It contradicts our Null hypothesis. Alternate hypothesis is reverse of Null hypothesis.
  
 3. Here we perform some kinds of experiments, (statistical analysis)
    There are different types of statistical analysis, we do statistical analysis to find if
	  null hypothesis should be accepted or rejected.
	  
  here we collect proofs,(DNA,Fingerprint test,)
  
 4. From the statistical analysis, we can judge/conclude whether to accept the Null hypothesis or to reject it.
  
  Eg: A person has made crime,and taken to court then  person is not guilty untill he is proved that he commited mistake.
  
  
  
  Q. Colleges at distr. A states it's pass percentage of students are 85%.A new colllege is opened in the distr. and it was found that a sample of 100 students have pass % of 90% with 
  a standard deviation of 4%?
  
  Does this college have a different pass %?
  
  Define Null hypothesis, it says H0 = mean = mue = 85%
   Alternate hypothesis = H1 = mean = mue != 85%
   
   Here we need to understand 2 values "p" value and significance value.
