    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of the mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "The first step in any machine learning algorithm is data preprocessing. In decision tree classification, this involves converting the input data into a format that can be used by the algorithm. This includes cleaning the data, removing duplicates, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Choosing the Root Node\n",
    "The next step is to choose the root node of the decision tree. This is the starting point for the algorithm, and all subsequent decisions are based on the value of the feature at the root node. The goal is to choose a feature that provides the maximum information gain, which is a measure of how well the feature splits the data into the different output classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Choosing the Splitting Criteria\n",
    "Once the root node has been selected, the next step is to choose the splitting criteria for each subsequent node in the tree. This involves calculating the information gain for each feature, which measures the reduction in entropy (or disorder) achieved by splitting the data based on that feature. The feature with the highest information gain is selected as the splitting criteria for that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Building the Tree\n",
    "The decision tree is built recursively by adding new nodes to the tree until all the training data has been classified correctly. Each node is split based on the feature with the highest information gain, and the process continues until a stopping criteria is met (e.g., the tree has reached a maximum depth, or there are no more features to split on).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Pruning the Tree\n",
    "After the tree has been built, it may be necessary to prune some of the nodes to avoid overfitting. This involves removing nodes that do not contribute significantly to the accuracy of the model. This can be done using various techniques, such as reduced error pruning or cost complexity pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6: Making Predictions\n",
    "Once the decision tree has been built and pruned, it can be used to make predictions on new data. This involves traversing the tree based on the values of the input features until a leaf node is reached, which corresponds to a specific output class. The predicted class is then returned as the output of the algorithm.\n"

    "An example of a classification problem where recall is the most important metric is in detecting fraudulent transactions in financial transactions. In this problem, the goal is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not based on various features such as transaction amount, location, and time."

    "In addition, fraudsters are constantly adapting and evolving their techniques, making it difficult to detect fraud with high precision. \n",
    "This is why recall is crucial, as it ensures that as many fraudulent transactions as possible are detected, even if some legitimate transactions are incorrectly flagged as fraudulent. \n",
    "Thus, the focus is on catching all fraudulent transactions (maximizing recall) and minimizing false negatives, which is why recall is the most important metric in this classification problem."
