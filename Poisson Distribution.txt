Poisson Distribution:
===============
  what exactly is poisson distribution for??
   It is for discrete distribution.
   
   when we have a Random variable that is following poisson distribution then it is discrete 
     random variable.
	 
	 
It describes the number of events occuring in a fixed time interval.
Eg: no. of people visiting hospital every hour.
  no. of people visiting bank every hour.
  no. of people visiting airport every hour.
  
  For graph, we can have hour number ranging over X axis, and no.of people visiting in that hour can range over Y axis.
  
  "lambda" is an important parameter of poisson distribution.
   lambda = 3 -> it talks about expected number of events to occur at every time interval.
   
   lambda helps us to create PMF with this probability.
   
   Let us assume lambda=3(mean=3)
   P(X=5) = In the 5th hour what is the probability that an event will occur.
     = (e^-lambda * (lambda)^x) / x!  = (e^-3 * 3^5)/5! = 0.101 (This will be probability on Y axis)
	 
	 
	 similarly we can compute P(X=4), P(X=3)
	 
	 
Mean and Variance for Poisson distribution:
==================
 Mean = E(X) Expectation of X = mue =lambda * t.
   lambda = expected number of events to occur every hour.  t= time interval

 variance = mue = lambda * t

so mean and variance is given by same thing in poisson distribution.
