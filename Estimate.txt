Estimate:
=============
 Till now whatever we have learnt is all about Descriptive statistics.(Different types of distribution)
 
 It is a specified observed numerical value used to estimate an unknown population parameter.
 
 In Inferential statistics, we make/draw conclusions from sample data which actually holds for 
   complete population.
   
 Types of Estimate:
 ===============
1.Point estimate(single numerical value used to estimate an unknown population parameter
  Eg: sample mean is a point estimate of a population 
  
  let us consider a population whose mean is mue, and we have a sample(subset) for this population, where we try to find point estimate and we try to make conclusion for this population parameter(mean).
  
  
  
  Now the sample mean is called point estimate. so it becomes a point estimate to draw some 
   conclusions on population mean.
   
   point estimate can have some margin of error, where it can be >(greater) than observed 
    population mean. So it is always better to define intervals.
	
	So we have 2nd type of estimate.
  
2.Interval estimate:
  Range of values used to estimate the unknown population parameter.
  Here we have range of values instead of just a point estimate we can have some margin error
   between some maximum and minimum value.
   
  So here this range is called Confidence Interval. 
  
  we are defining confidence interval, this is called Interval estimate for sample mean.
  This(defining confidence interval) is done to estimate population parameter.
  
  here we might don't know population mean(mue), but we try to estimate population mean(mue)
   through interval estimate.
