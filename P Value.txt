P Value:
======
P value is a number, calculated from a statistical test, that describes how likely you are to 
 have found a particular set of observations, if the null hypothesis were true. P values are 
 used in hypothesis testing, to help decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
 
 It helps us to make conclusions about population data.
 
 Eg:In space bar, we mostly touch at middle of key, we rarely touch at the bottom edges of key
 
 So here the distribution is also Normal/Gaussian.
 Assume at some point on key, we have "p" value of 0.2 what does that mean?
 -> It means out of 100 touches in space bar, we touch around 20 times in that particular region.
 
 "p" value talks about the probability, of a specific outcome in a specific region.
 Assume at center, we have "p" value as 0.8 
 
 
 Eg of hypothesis testing:
  we define null hypothesis, then alternate hypothesis and then do statistical analysis.
  The outcome of statistical test is "p" value.
  
  Assume we want to do hypothesis testing on a coin to find out whether it is fair or not.
  let us consider the P(H)=P(T)=0.5
  
  so here if we toss a coin for many times, then through bernoulli distribution 50% of times,
   we get Tail and 50% of times head will come.
  So we can say the coin is fair.


 case 2: Let us consider P(H)=0.6 and P(T)=0.4
          This might happen 
 case 3: Let us consider P(H)=0.7 and P(T)=0.3
        Now this is unacceptable, now we can confirm this experiment through hypothesis testing
		
	1.Define null hypothesis(H0) = coin is fair
  	2.Alternate hypothesis : (H1) = coin is not fair.
	3. the experiment that we are going to perform.
	
 we toss the coin for 100 times. we try to plot graph, where on x axis, we have number of times heads appeared and on Y axis we have what is the probability of it.
 
 Now if mean is around 50, then it means coin is fair.
 
 assume for 100 tosses, we got 70 times head and 30 times tail
 
 Here let's define a confidence interval, let it be from 30 to 70(CI range)
  what should be the range for confidence interval??
  -> domain expert will be used over here, here if we are tossing the coin and if it is between 30 and 70, then we consider our coin as fair.

 Now if the number of heads that we get is out of confidence interval, i.e either < 30 or > 70. Then it means the coin is not fair.

 How do we define the confidence interval??
 -> An important parameter called significance value(alpha) let alpha=0.05

 CI =  1 - 0.05 = 0.95
 
Q. who will set the significance value and how isit related to "P" value?
  significance value is decided by domain experts, based on problem statement this value will 
    differ.
	
	So the area between 30 and 70 is of 95% confidence interval and the 5% area is equally distributed on left of 30 and right of 70.
	
	Now let's say we get "p" value. "p" value is computed from this statistical experiment.
	
	
-> To calculate "p" value, we have tests like z-test, t-test,
If "p" value < significance value at left side or "p" value > significance value at right side, then we have to reject null hypothesis. So these 2 areas are rejection areas for null
hypothesis.  

 if "p" value < significance value -> reject null hypothesis so alternate hypothesis will be 
    accepted here.
	(here it means, our value is coming outside of confidence interval)
	
 else we fail to reject null hypothesis -> so null hypothesis
 
 
 95% CI means with respect to any experiment that we perform if it is coming within the region, then we accept the null hypothesis.
