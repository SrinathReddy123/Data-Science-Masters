===================================
In most books it is there like Prob. distri. func. is same as prob. dens. func.

Prob. distr. func. is a part of prob. dens. func.

why do we use prob. dens. function??

** -> probability density funtion is for continuous random variables. 
 
 prob. dens. funct. -> It talks about distribution of continuous data.
 -> It is specifically used for 
 
 let's us consider heght of students:
  for this we can create histogram.  we smoothen the histogram.
  
  on X-axis - we can have heights of students and on Y axis, we can have probabilities (like  
    0.1,0.2, ...)
	
By using this distribution, we can derive some important information.
 we want to find what is the probability that height is < 155cm.
 prob. that random variable will take value whose height is < 155cm ??
 
  -> we can find it by calculating the area under the curve. From the left extreme side what 
   is the area under the curve.
   Here probability will always lie between 0 and 1.
   
   
  How the Prob. dens. func. curve is created??
    We use Kernel density estimator.
	
Q. What is the difference between Probability density function and probability distribution function??
 In probability distribution function, we have various types, where prob. dens. func. is 1 of the types. (we are specifically trying to create a curve which specifies the distribution 
 of continuous data.)
 
 probability distribution function also has probability mass function as one of it's type, here we see the distribution of a discrete random variable.
 Eg: rolling a die - we know that outcome will be from one of the possible outcomes{1,2,3,4,5,6}
 
 Here we can find the probability for what possible outcome i.e for {1,2,3,4,5,6}
 Let X be the random variable that tells what is the number that will appear upon rolling die.
  P(X=1)= ?, P(X=2)= ?, P(X=3)= ?, ...
  
  Here if we consider that die is fair, then each of the outcome is equally likely and so
    P(X=1)=P(X=2)=P(X=3)=1/6.
	
	we can represent probabilities as bar chart and when we smoothen the chart and make it curve, then it becomes probability mass function.


** probability mass function is for discrete random variables.	
  P(X<=4)= Probability of random variable X taking a value <=4 = 
           P(X=1)+ P(X=2)+ P(X=3)+ P(X=4)
  For a fair die = 1/6 * 4 = 4/6.

when we have discrete random variable, then we should use probability mass function to show the distribution of graph. 


Cumulative distribution function.(CDF)
===============================
we are trying to do cumulative sum.(Adding every area with respect to every point till that 
 point from the left).
probabitity sum upto a certain point is called CDF.
Probability till a particular point is known as CDF.

CDF will always be increasing. (monotonically non-decreasing)

-> we will be doing the cumulative sum of all the values with respect to the area under the curve. 


** Sum of all the probabilities will always be "1".
