    "It's worth noting that both types of regularization have limitations and trade-offs. Ridge regularization can reduce the impact of correlated predictors, but may not perform well when there are a large number of irrelevant predictors. Lasso regularization can perform feature selection, but may not work well when the predictors are highly correlated. In some cases, a combination of both types of regularization, such as Elastic Net regularization, can be used to balance these trade-offs."

Both Ridge regularization and Lasso regularization have limitations and trade-offs, and it's important to consider the specific characteristics of the data when selecting a regularization method."
