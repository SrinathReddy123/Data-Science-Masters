Student T distribution:
==============
In Z stats. when we perform any analysis using z-score, we require pop.std. dev. (sigma) but 
  it is already known.
  
  pop.std. dev. is very difficult to get calculated, to get assumed also because we don't have
   entire population data
   
Q. How do we perform any analysis when we don't know the population std. deviation??
 ->  For such instances we use Student T distribution
 
 actual z-score = ("x" bar - mue(population mean))/((sigma)/(n^1/2)) 
   here "x" bar -> sample mean     sigma -> population std. dev.
   
   t-score = ("x" bar - mue(population mean))/(sample std. dev./(n^1/2))
    -> we use sample std. dev. instead of pop. std. dev.
	
when using z-stats, we use z-table to find the area under the curve.

In student t-table, we will be using "t-table"	
 In t-table, there is 1 more parameter, called Degree of freedom 
  dof = n-1
  
  
 Let us consider there r 3 people in room, with 3 chairs and select 1 of them, then for 2nd 
   person there r 2 choices, then for 3rd person there is only 1 choice.
   
  So here dof = 3-1 = 2

we can call this test as t-test or student t-test.
