=====================================
probability mass function:
 ==============
  Here the random variable is Discrete random variable.
  PMF                                          CDF(Cumulative distribution function)
Eg: rolling a die
 {1,2,3,4,5,6}
assume as fair die then each outcome is equally likely.
 P(X=1)=P(X=2)=P(X=3)= P(X=4)=P(X=5)=P(X=6) = 1/6.
                                               |we try to cumulatively add the probabilities 
											     till the probability for that random value.
                                                | P(X<=4)= P(X=1)+ P(X=2)+ P(X=3)+ P(X=4)=4/6
												
 Here on X-axis, we can have values that our    |  P(X=2) =2/6
 random variable can take and on Y axis, we can have| P(X=3) =3/6
 what is the probability that RV can take that value.|  P(X=5) = 5/6
 here 1/6 for each value.                              | P(X=6) = 1(6/6)
 
 
 
 P(X<=4) =  P(X=1)+ P(X=2)+ P(X=3)+ P(X=4)
 CDF will helps us in finding such probabilities.
 
 
 P(X<=6) =  P(X=1)+ P(X=2)+ P(X=3)+ P(X=4) + P(X=5)+ P(X=6)
 
 when each and every outcome of a random variable is equally probable,(means having equal
   probability) then it is called uniform distribution. 
   
   
 Probability Density function 
========================
It is applicable for continuous random variables.

let us consider, on x-axis we have height and on Y axis, we have probability.
Now if we have the curve, and for RV taking a value, if probability at that value on Y axis is something, then that is not the exact required probability.

From the mean, if the curve is similar on both sides then it is symmetric curve.
So from mean,the left part of it will have 50% of entire distribution and on the right side of
 curve we have 50% of distribution.
 
 
 At any point we find the gradient, gradient basically means the slope(derivative)
