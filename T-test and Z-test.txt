T-test and Z-test:
==================
  when to use T-test vs Z-test:
    Do you know the population standard deviation(sigma) from problem statement we have.
If Yes -> Is the sample size above 30?  ->  Yes then use z-test.
                                        -> No, use the T-test.

 No -> use the T-test.
