Type 1 & Type 2 Errors:
==============
 Reality: Null hypothesis is True, or Null hypothesis is false
 Decision : Null hypothesis is True, or Null hypothesis is false

Outcome 1: we reject the Null hypothesis, when in reality it is false -> it is good scenario.
          correct scenario.
   
Outcome 2: we reject the Null hypothesis, when in reality it is true  -> this is an error.
  This error is called Type1 error.
  
Outcome 3: we retain the Null hypothesis, when in reality it is false -> this is an error.
  This error is called Type2 error.
  
Outcome 4: we retain the Null hypothesis, when in reality it is true -> this is acceptable.
