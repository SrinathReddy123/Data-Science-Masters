    "A high accuracy means that the model is making correct predictions most of the time, while a low accuracy means that the model is making more incorrect predictions. However, accuracy alone can be misleading if the dataset is imbalanced or if the cost of false positives and false negatives is not equal. In such cases, it is necessary to look at the other metrics calculated from the confusion matrix to get a better understanding of the model's performance."

    "Check for class imbalance: A confusion matrix can reveal if the model is biased towards predicting one class over another. If one class has significantly more predictions than the others, it could be an indication of class imbalance, where the dataset has a disproportionate number of instances for one class. In such cases, the model may be overfitting to the majority class, resulting in poor performance on the minority classes.\n",

    "Analyze false positives and false negatives: False positives and false negatives can indicate potential biases or limitations in a model. For instance, if the model is consistently predicting false positives for a particular class, it could be an indication that the features used to train the model are not representative of that class, or that the model is biased towards another class. Similarly, false negatives could suggest that the model is missing important features for that class, or that the model is biased towards another class.\n",

    "Evaluate performance across different subgroups: If the dataset includes subgroups, such as age or gender, the confusion matrix can reveal if the model is performing differently across these subgroups.
