Uniform distribution:
===================
we have 2 types:
 1. continuous uniform distribution - here we create a pdf(probability density function)
 2. discrete uniform distribution - here we create a pdf(probability mass function)
 
 
 1. continuous uniform distribution - has a continuous random variable.
 ===============
 In probability theory and Statistics, the continuous uniform distribution or rectangular distribution is a family of symmetric probability distribution.
 
 - The distribution describes an experiment, where there is an arbitrary outcome that lies between certain bounds.
 - The bounds are defined by the parameters a and b, which are maximum and minimum values.
  The interval can either be closed(eg:[a,b]) or opened(eg:(a,b))
  

  
In this experiment, we have outcomes thatb lie between certain bounds.
Notation: U(a,b)
parameters: a,b where -infinity < a < b < infinity.  where "a" being minimum and "b" being the maximum.

pdf : = { 1/(b-a)   for x belongs to [a,b]
      = { 0         otherwise
	  
cdf : = { 0  for x < a	
        { (x-a)/(b-a)   for x belongs to [a,b]
        { 1 	   for x>b

Mean = (a+b)/2 = Median
Variance = 1/12 * (b-a)^2		
	  
Eg : The no. of candies sold daily at a shop is uniformly distributed with a minimum of 10 and maximum of 40.
1. What is the probability of daily sales to fall between 15 and 30?
 Here a=10 and b=40. 	  1/(b-a) = 1/30.

we need to find area under the curve 15 and 30.

P(15<=x<=30) = area of rectangle = length * breadth = (30-15) * 1/30 = 15/30 = 0.5

2.What is the probability of daily sales > 20.
  p(x>=20) = area = length * breadth = (40-20) * 1/30 = 2/3 =  0.667
  
  
2. discrete uniform distribution - here it does have discrete random variable
===================
In probability theory and Statistics, the discrete uniform distribution	is a symmetric probability distribution where in a finite number of values are equally likely to be observed.
every one of n values has equal probability 1/n.

Another way of saying discrete uniform distribution would be a known finite number of outcomes
 equally likely to happen.
 
Eg: Rolling a fair die, then P(x=1)= P(x=2)=... P(x=6)= 1/6
Here for this we can consider a=1 and b=6 and every possible value between a and b including both of them will take equal probability = 1/n.

where "n" is the number of numbers between "a" and "b"(including "a" and "b")
 n = (b-a)+1
 
 Notations:
 ===========
 U(a,b)
 parameters: a,b where b>a
 PMF = 1/n
 
 Mean = (a+b)/2
